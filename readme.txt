Steps to Compile:
Compiled on Visual Studio 2010 Express.
OS: Windows 8.1

Bugs:
None.

Minor Changes:
-For Strings, spaces (' ') have been replaced
 with underscores ('_').

Problem Approach:
-I decided to break up each different type of
 token at the start. Then I filtered through
 each of them, one at a time, determining what,
 if any, token they were. I also had the program
 print to a file for convenience.

Notes:
-Some function don't have comments explaining
 what they do, because the names explain what
 they do.
